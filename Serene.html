<p>Never touch the glass. Be mindful of glass surfaces mainly windows.</p>

<p>Fingerprints, there are multiple surfaces on your vehicle that are prone to fingerprints and stains. A good rule of thumb is to keep your hands clean and dry. It is no easy task removing grease stains from lotions, and they may sometimes even settle in meaning they are permanent.</p>
 
<p>Bringing in dirt and ruble. Get a feel and look at your feet/shoes, give them a quick rub on a more or less clean surface where you are standing, this will help minimize the small rocks, leaves and dirt you bring into your vehicle.</p>

<p>When opening doors, it is a good idea to put your hand underneath/above the handle pull and let the momentum swing to a 15-degree angle, just enough to get the palm of your hand on the edge of the vehicle door and open it the rest of the way as needed to enter. Close the door using its own momentum and with four finger tips in the inner pocket of the door panel. This will leave unsightly finger prints out of sight from the inside and outside of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Touch screens in vehicle. Back to the finger print rule, keep hands clean and dry, be precise with what you want to do with your screen. If you have knobs/buttons, use them to minimize dirtying your screen.</p>

<p>Dash board, never place anything on the dash board, ladies its not a foot rest. Use your glove box for documents, cd’s, (if you still use them) or for your gun.</p>
 
<p>Maintaining leather/cloth, when in leather seats it is best to clear out the creases in the seat with a soft brush or vacuum with a soft brush tip, in order to prevent friction and debris from cutting into the leather or cloth in due time. Plus, for leather use a quality cleaning/conditioning spray, to keep leather soft, pliable, crack prevention, fading, staining, and overall longevity of the leather. For cloth invest in a stain extractor, and remove stains as needed. You can also purchase a cleaner like Tuff Stuff, and with a clean medium brush clean affected areas as needed. There are products that already contain Scotch Guard, which provides protection from future staining.</p>

<p>Always clear out trash from car when you leave your vehicle. Whether you’re getting down at home or at a Walgreens, spot out a nearby trash can outside the store, then pick out any receipts, drinks etc. and throw them out. Never let anything build up in your vehicle.</p>

<p>Eating in the car. This is risking a spill, and fingerprint hell as well as crumbs falling in-between the crevices of the seat leading to future damage. Eat at the restaurant or wait to get down. If you must eat in the vehicle place a napkin or two on your lap to minimize crumbs and lose food from falling in the car. For drinks in the vehicle place one of the provided napkins under your drink, to absorb the condensation and prevents a small puddle of water that may lead to staining later after several uses.</p> 

<p>Outer surface of the vehicle. Your vehicles paint surface is delicate and can easily scratch with a speck of dust. Be mindful and never place keys, purses, laptops, cell phones, babies, pets, coats…but Rudy could I place a soft fluffy blanket on the vehicle? NO NOT ANYTHING EVER!!! EVER!!! Phew had a little moment there. EVER!!! There I’m done. Follow all of the above always, no in-betweens, and you will have a vehicle that last you longer cleaner, and a joy to ride in. you will never grow tired of your vehicle, and it is just so enjoyable to drive you will feel great always. And your vehicle and how clean you keep it will always stand out. Remember there are many like it, but this one is yours and looks better than yours.</p>

  <h3>Testimonials</h3>
  <p><p>“They left my vehicle looking better than when I bought it from the dealership.” -Julian</p>

<P>“I have six kids and a Shih Tzu the interior of my Suburban was horrific, I was embarrassed for them to see the interior and the state that it was in, but Rudy was extremely professional and left my vehicle looking better than the day that I bought it.” -Erika
</p>

<p>“If you want to get your paint swirled and damaged go to Blue Wave, or El Tigre. You won’t find that here, they use top quality products, not that bulk mystery soap that others use. Got bugs all over your front end? They don’t use that acid product to knock them off, they use a pH balanced cleaner that will not burn your paint, or remove existing sealants, such as waxes.  I am just a paying customer that has experienced and found a place that treats your ride with care and respect no matter what make or model.” -Steve </p></p>
