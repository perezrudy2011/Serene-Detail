<p>“They left my vehicle looking better than when I bought it from the dealership.” -Julian</p>

<P>“I have six kids and a Shih Tzu the interior of my Suburban was horrific, I was embarrassed for them to see the interior and the state that it was in, but Rudy was extremely professional and left my vehicle looking better than the day that I bought it.” -Erika

<p>“If you want to get your paint swirled and damaged go to Blue Wave, or El Tigre. You won’t find that here, they use top quality products, not that bulk mystery soap that others use. Got bugs all over your front end? They don’t use that acid product to knock them off, they use a pH balanced cleaner that will not burn your paint, or remove existing sealants, such as waxes.  I am just a paying customer that has experienced and found a place that treats your ride with care and respect no matter what make or model.” -Steve </p>
